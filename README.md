[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/collinewait/ika-gmail-scraper-backend.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/collinewait/ika-gmail-scraper-backend) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/collinewait/ika-gmail-scraper-backend/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/collinewait/ika-gmail-scraper-backend?branch=develop)

This app downloads attachments sent by a specific email. I had a couple of attachments sent to me over a long period of time. So I decided to create this app to download them at once. A command-line version of the application can be found [here](https://github.com/collinewait/gmail-scraper-go).
